        <h3 class="text-info text-center">What is CILogon 2.0?</h3>
        When scientists work together, they use web sites and other software to share their ideas and data.
        To ensure the integrity of their work, these systems require the scientists to log in and verify that they
        are part of the team working on a particular science problem. Too often, the identity and access verification
        process is a stumbling block for the scientists. Scientific research projects are forced to invest time and
        effort into developing and supporting Identity and Access Management (IdAM) services, distracting them from
        the core goals of their research collaboration. The "CILogon 2.0" project provides an IdAM platform that
        enables scientists to work together to meet their IdAM needs more effectively so they can allocate more time
        and effort to their core mission of scientific research. To ensure that the project makes a real contribution
        to scientific collaborations, the researchers have partnered with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
        Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration, the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves
        (NANOGrav) Physics Frontiers Center, and the Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE). The project also
        provides training and outreach to additional scientific collaborations, and the project supports integration
        with the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), which provides a national-scale
        cyberinfrastructure for scientific research in the US.

        <h3 class="text-info text-center">What is COmanage</h3>
        COmanage provides collaboration management services for CILogon 2.0. COmanage enables research collaborations
        (virtual organizations or VOs) to manage the entire lifecycle of collaboration. Beginning with onboarding,
        COmanage provides flexible and customizable enrollment flows to bring people and their federated identities
        onto the platform and create a collaborative organization (CO). Each CO may have multiple active enrollment
        flows tailored specifically for particular types of collaborators such as faculty, students, or staff, and each
        flow may onboard users by invitation, self signup, and even conscription. During enrollment COmanage consumes
        the details about a userâ€™s federated identity provided by their home organization and records it as an
        organizational identity. After enrollment the organizational identity is linked to the CO person identity
        representing the user as part of the CO or VO. Because researchers today may hail from multiple organizations
        and often participate in multiple VOs simultaneously COmanage supports linking multiple organizational
        identities
        to multiple CO person identities.
