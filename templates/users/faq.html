          The user's Role determines their ability to create, read, update and delete various items within Notary
          Service. Role's are selected from the Preferences section of the user's profile page. A user can only
          operate as one role at a time. If a user has multiple roles available to them, they can switch
          between the available roles to accomplish different tasks.
